## Introduction

This project provides a flexible C# implementation of Rankers for Microsoft's Semantic Kernel, a state-of-the-art ranking function used by search engines, **enhanced with advanced natural language processing capabilities**.  
With this library, you can rerank search results or candidate passages using sophisticated tokenization, lemmatization, stop word removal, and multi-language support through the Catalyst NLP library.
